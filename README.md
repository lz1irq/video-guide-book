The Conference Video Guide Book
===============================

The goal of this book is to collect, organize and share our knowledge
and experience in recording and streaming audio and video from presentations,
conferences and other events.

## Building the book

To build a PDF of the book, you are going to need `pandoc` and `texlive`. To
get the exact package names, consult the documentation of your OS of choice.

You simply need to run `make` in the repository root folder.

You can also build manually:

`pandoc chapters/*.md -o book.pdf` 


## Contributing

If you can contribute, please do so! But first, check the issues to see if someone is already working on your topic. Synchronize
with them to avoid duplicating work.
